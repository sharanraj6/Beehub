    <h3>What?</h3>
    <p>
      BeeHub is a social networking app built using Ruby on Rails.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Why?</h3>
    <p>
      I am not building the next Facebook. Given that there are enough social networks already I don't want to end up launching one. Pointless! So why am I building? I want to try and learn how to develop a social network and in the process show you how easy it is done using Rails. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>How?</h3>
    <p>
      As stated above it's a Ruby on Rails application. Frontend is developed using Twitter Bootstrap. Database is SQLite for development and Postgresql for production.
